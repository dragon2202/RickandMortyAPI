# Rick and Morty API
This small project is me pulling from a public API for Rick and Morty (https://rickandmortyapi.com/) to display all characters, locations and episodes in the vast multiverse of Rick and Morty. I also implemented small mobile design which will change pages based of screen's width length.

## Tech Used 
### React(https://reactjs.org/)
### React BootStrap(https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
### SASS(https://ant.design/) 

## Questions
I respond to emails within a day or so, so feel free to ask me any questions. Spam and unwanted harrassment will lead to a block.

### Location Overview
This page displays a specific location in the Rick and Morty Universe. It displays the current residents, characters that are current present in location. It does not display a character based on their origin, if they were originally from there. As current Rick and Morty are from a different universe for an example.

### Episodes
This page displays all episodes from the show. I did not implemnt a search because it's displayed in an ascending order based on episodes and there's a very few amount of episodes. The table displays 20 episodes, and each season is around 10 episodes. Using pagination you can roughly guess where each season is.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
